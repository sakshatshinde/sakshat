# Today I found out something amazing
So I opened my discord, as one does when they get on their computer. And there was a prompt saying press `Shift + ESC`. I couldn't read what it was for, but I decided to give it a shot thinking it must be some newly added feature. 

> Am I over-reacting? How many people know about this?

#### Anyway here are some screenshots.

- edge

So I thought if the edge has it, other browsers might also have this feature, and I googled a bit.

- firefox

Now, we can see how much extensions affect browser performance. For sure, I am going to use these tools to determine what extensions are worth it.

Hope you enjoyed learning something new! ðŸ’–
