Recently, the youtube algorithm has proven fruitful, and it has sucessfully turned me into an information hogging goblin. This all started when I stumbled upon a podcast called [`startalk`](https://startalkmedia.com/) hosted by Neil deGrasse Tyson. While listening to this it reignited my lost appetite for science and physics. Refreshing on the topics like [`parallel universes`](https://www.space.com/32728-parallel-universes.html), [`general and special relativity`](https://theaveragescientist.co.uk/2024/01/08/understanding-the-differences-special-relativity-vs-general-relativity/) and [`string theory`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Da-2h2B4faU).

I remember during my freshman year of engineering we ~studied~ tried to study time dilation and length contraction, didn't go well obviously so I tried to understand it more deeply and eventually made peace with my limited understanding of the subject, like I get it but I really don't.

Some books I read on these subjects are -

- The Theory Of Everything by Stephen Hawking [Buy on amazon](https://amzn.to/3WwAGFi)
- The Grand Design by Stephen Hawking, Leonard Mlodinow [Buy on amazon](https://amzn.to/46cnQPS)
- A Brief History Of Time by Stephen Hawking [Buy on amazon](https://amzn.to/3Wg5mJK)

During my school days I also read a series called George's Secret Key to the Universe by Stephen Hawking, Lucy Hawking. Its a great children's book series and cannot recommend it enough.

Some fascinating topics in biology like [`flagellar motor`](https://theaveragescientist.co.uk/2024/01/08/understanding-the-differences-special-relativity-vs-general-relativity/) do make me think if the universe is just recursive.
