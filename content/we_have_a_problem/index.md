# We have a problem

In this new reality where A.I. is being pushed onto developers by their ~~masters~~ C-Suites `in the hopes of boosting short-term productivity` - the foundations of tomorrow are being built by clueless coasters `leveraging AI`. Your average joe ships code watching companies profit every year while still also sees that their co-workers are getting laid off. Can yo blame them for being coasters? Where `maximising shareholder value` is the only ultimate goal for modern software shops.

I am not trying to justify this behavior - it should be taken this into consideration when we are talking about the new software that's being written today. Most people, well maybe not the most but a sizeable chunk of software engineers  seem to be relying on A.I to write production software for them and its not pretty or reliable - but can we blame them?

# A.I. is good enough... is what it looks like

Today A.I. is good enough to get things into a `working state`. All spaghetti however, as I said earlier loyalty to a corporation isn't really the vibe these days. This sentiment is added with mediocre at best or downright bad code is being shipped which passes all the test cases (again written by A.I.) and goes straight to production.

I feel sorry for every engineer today because we are going to inherit this spaghetti and I hope by then we would have something sentient, if not I will meet you at my farm - no way I am going to deal with legacy A.I slop.
