# Why Kazakhstan?

Tbh, I didn't even know Kazakhstan ğŸ‡°ğŸ‡¿ existed. One of my dear friend `Sujit` discovered what Central-Asia was when one of his co-workers moved abroad to Tajikistan ğŸ‡¹ğŸ‡¯. It looked beautiful judging by the photos on the internet, and we were planning to visit some place outside india for quite a long time. Sujit found out about Kazakhstan ğŸ‡°ğŸ‡¿ while researching about Central Asia, to our surprise it was `Visa-Free`. Considering how bad indian passport really is, we started looking into what Kazakhstan ğŸ‡°ğŸ‡¿ had to offer. We found the following things...

- `1` India Rupee = `5.40` Kazakhstani Tenge [Feb 2024]
- Accomadation was cheap and comparable to the indian market, sometimes it was even cheaper
- Skiing in Kazakhstan ğŸ‡°ğŸ‡¿ is cheaper than Kashmir, India ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡³ by a factor of `10`
- Mumbai `BOM` to Almaty `ALA` return flights are cheaper than most domestic flights within India ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡³ `â‚¹12.5k ~ $150`
- Public transport is cheaper in Kazakhstan ğŸ‡°ğŸ‡¿ compared to India ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡³
