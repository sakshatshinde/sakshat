# Why Kazakhstan ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡¿

Tbh, I didn't even know Kazakhstan ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡¿ existed. One of my dear friend `Sujit` discovered what Central-Asia was, when one of his co-workers moved abroad to Tajikistan ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡¯. It looked beautiful judging by the photos on the internet, and we were planning to visit some place outside India ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ for quite a long time. Sujit stumbled upon Kazakhstan ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡¿ while researching about Central-Asia, to our surprise it was `Visa-Free`. Considering how bad indian passport really is, we started looking into what Kazakhstan ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡¿ had to offer. We found the following things...

- `1` Indian Rupee = `5.40` Kazakhstani Tenge [Feb 2024]
- Accomadation was cheap and comparable to the indian market, sometimes it was even cheaper
- Skiing in Kazakhstan ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡¿ is cheaper than Kashmir, India ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ by a factor of `10`
- Mumbai `BOM` to Almaty `ALA` return flights are cheaper than most domestic flights within India ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ `â‚¹12.5k ~ $150`
- Public transport is cheap in Kazakhstan ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡¿ You pay a `100 ã€’` and get off wherever you want
- It is beautiful, and tourist-free
- Almaty and Astana governments are pushing for more tourist schemes like [Almaty City Pass](https://almaty.citypass.kz/en/) and [Astana Pass](https://astana.citypass.kz/en/)

# Things to look out for

Do not get a private taxi from the airport no matter what. It is a scam. Always book taxis through `YandexGo`. 

Only convert fractional of your `USD $` to `KZT ã€’` for getting your SIM and taxi to your accomodation. Please use something like [`MiG exchange`](https://maps.app.goo.gl/NAHn6hNUMA8a2w2U8) when you get to downtown - iirc there is one near the airport as well - ask your taxi driver to stop by the nearest MiG.

Kazakhs love meat, I mean they REALLY love meat - if you are vegan/vegetarian goodluck. I could only eat fruits and few shops had very limited vegetarian options, which frankly I am not sure were actually vegetarian because in Kazakhstan ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡¿ there are no labels or distinction on food products. We just ended up using Google Translate on the ingredients list for the entirety of our trip.

People here don't speak english. `Google Translate` is indispensable, most people speak Russian and Kazakh. The only people we found who spoke english were the immigration agents at the airport. Because of this travelling alone is an adventure in itself.

Fashion. Apparently dressing colorful here is something most people don't do - I think its more of a European-Culture thing than just an Kazakh thing. Regardless pack dull colors of clothes if you can. Another thing, people here don't usually smile - it is considered a sign of `stupidity`. I personally don't have an opinion on this, it's a cultural thing and smiling didn't get us into trouble and we were smiliing 24x7 while we were in Kazakhstan ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡¿. Off-course you get a `foreigner-pass` so don't fret about it.

I'd usually tell people to be beware about shady areas but in Almaty even those areas were quite ok, they didn't feel as bad or scary. It was mostly people over-staying their visas and living in old apartments trying to earn a living. We couldn't find any homeless people there.

Please do not take Ski equipment on public transport if possible, if you do - there is apparently an extra charge for it. But once you go to Shymbulak - you as a tourist can rarely find a way to get back to the city because cab-hailing services like YandexGo don't support cash payments when you are out of city limits so we had to use the `trolley-bus` to get off the mountain. While booking a cab always choose a `Mini-Van` on YandexGo because others won't be able to fit your equipment. Get your equipment from stores like [Free Life](https://maps.app.goo.gl/yJFiiakgkXtPRcpM9), they offer amazing rental prices with no deposit needed (however you do need some sort of id which can be used as a collateral).

Be careful of booking your stay via any aggregator. I mentioned what happened to us in the `Memorable incidents` section. Just have a backup plan. Try to not get stranded in `-24Â°C` at 01:00 am after a 6 hr flight and a 3.5 hr train journey like we did.

Suprisingly we didn't come across any tourist traps except the private taxis, I guess because there are not a lot of tourists and even those are mostly russian tourists.
