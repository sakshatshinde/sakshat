# Why Kazakhstan 🇰🇿

Tbh, I didn't even know Kazakhstan 🇰🇿 existed. One of my dear friend `Sujit` discovered what Central-Asia was, when one of his co-workers moved abroad to Tajikistan 🇹🇯. It looked beautiful judging by the photos on the internet, and we were planning to visit some place outside India 🇮🇳 for quite a long time. Sujit stumbled upon Kazakhstan 🇰🇿 while researching about Central-Asia, to our surprise it was `Visa-Free`. Considering how bad indian passport really is, we started looking into what Kazakhstan 🇰🇿 had to offer. We found the following things...

- `₹ 1` Indian Rupee = `〒 5.40` Kazakhstani Tenge [Feb 2024]
- Accomadation was cheap and comparable to the indian market, sometimes it was even cheaper
- Skiing in Kazakhstan 🇰🇿 is cheaper than Kashmir, India 🇮🇳 by a factor of `10`
- Mumbai `BOM` to Almaty `ALA` return flights are cheaper than most domestic flights within India 🇮🇳 `₹12.5k ~ $150`
- Public transport is cheap in Kazakhstan 🇰🇿 You pay a `100 〒` and get off wherever you want
- It is beautiful, and tourist-free
- Almaty and Astana governments are pushing for more tourist schemes like [Almaty City Pass](https://almaty.citypass.kz/en/) and [Astana Pass](https://astana.citypass.kz/en/)

## However I'd also like to mention few places which were quite nice.

Cheapest place to get rental ski gear that we could find - [`Free Life - Kairbekov St. 16, Almaty 050000, Kazakhstan`](https://maps.app.goo.gl/H9sircE1Ew1FZ1Be8). The staff here was super nice. We asked them if we could return the skis after their working hours, they agreed without any fuss - and waited `30m` past their closing time. We really appreciated this gesture and want to give them a huge shoutout.If you are in Almaty please check them out.

We also randomly found a japanese shop - [`Yaponskiy Magazin Японский Магазин - Seyfullin Avenue 510, Almaty 050000, Kazakhstan`](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ddBxZhWUrcu1sGE3A). Stuff here was decent and the owner were hospitable. This one seems like a [retail chain](https://japanshop.kz/) shop so YMMV.

Later on we were trying to find a souvenir shop and stumbled upon [`SINICHKI.STORE -Almaty, Aiteke Bi Street, 53`](https://yandex.com/maps/org/sinichki_store/158032250117). Decent place and we were able to find few unique fridge magnets to take home (apparently Sujit collects fridge magents from the places he visits).

[`Dostyk Plaza`](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ZJrBqiX3LmCrW2689), was one of my favorite places here in Almaty. I know its just a mall but I really liked the vibe here. People seemed more friendly and talkative than the average bunch we met throughout our trip. I visited one of the clothing stores and a couple of cashiers rounded me up and had an `interogation` of sorts about my clothes and where they were from, where I was from and how did I get here. They were intrigued perhaps because I was the only one who didn't follow the social norm of wearing black/grey clothes and was standing out quite a bit - and off-course I didn't look like Kazakh. Clothes here in kazakhstan 🇰🇿 are almost as cheap if not cheaper than they're in India 🇮🇳

# Memorable incidents

I will write this eventually... gonna be a long one.

# Cost

It cost me `₹ 32,539` or `$ 390` all-inclusive even the return flights, some souvenirs and 2 kilograms of chocolate - ❤️ [Rakhat](https://www.rakhat.kz/en)

For Sujit itt was `₹ 31,396` or `$ 376` and for another friend Sharad it was `₹ 32,083` or `$ 385`.

I am pretty sure we would have spent more if we travelled domestically to [Jammu and Kashmir](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Qza6QA9x4upm1SJx9)

# Things to look out for

Do not get a private taxi from the airport no matter what. It is a scam. Always book taxis through `YandexGo`. 

Only convert fractional of your `USD $` to `KZT 〒` for getting your SIM and taxi to your accomodation. Please use something like [`MiG exchange`](https://maps.app.goo.gl/NAHn6hNUMA8a2w2U8) when you get to downtown - iirc there is one near the airport as well - ask your taxi driver to stop by the nearest MiG.

Kazakhs love meat, I mean they REALLY love meat - if you are vegan/vegetarian goodluck. I could only eat fruits and few shops had very limited vegetarian options, which frankly I am not sure were actually vegetarian because in Kazakhstan 🇰🇿 there are no labels or distinction on food products. We just ended up using Google Translate on the ingredients list for the entirety of our trip. If you want to order food online, use [Glovo](https://glovoapp.com/) its the Kazakh DoorDash/Swiggy.

People here don't speak english. `Google Translate` is indispensable, most people speak Russian and Kazakh. The only people we found who spoke english were the immigration agents at the airport. Because of this travelling alone is an adventure in itself.

Fashion. Apparently dressing colorful here is something most people don't do - I think its more of a European-Culture thing than just an Kazakh thing. Regardless pack dull colors of clothes if you can. Another thing, people here don't usually smile - it is considered a sign of `stupidity`. I personally don't have an opinion on this, it's a cultural thing and smiling didn't get us into trouble and we were smiliing 24x7 while we were in Kazakhstan 🇰🇿. Off-course you get a `foreigner-pass` so don't fret about it.

I'd usually tell people to be beware about shady areas but in Almaty even those areas were quite ok, they didn't feel as bad or scary. It was mostly people over-staying their visas and living in old apartments trying to earn a living. We couldn't find any homeless people there.

Please do not take Ski equipment on public transport if possible, if you do - there is apparently an extra charge for it. But once you go to Shymbulak - you as a tourist can rarely find a way to get back to the city because cab-hailing services like YandexGo don't support cash payments when you are out of city limits so we had to use the `trolley-bus` to get off the mountain. While booking a cab always choose a `Mini-Van` on YandexGo because others won't be able to fit your equipment. Get your equipment from stores like [Free Life](https://maps.app.goo.gl/yJFiiakgkXtPRcpM9), they offer amazing rental prices with no deposit needed (however you do need some sort of id which can be used as a collateral).

Be careful of booking your stay via any aggregator. I mentioned what happened to us in the `Memorable incidents` section. Just have a backup plan. Try to not get stranded in `-24°C` at 01:00 am after a 6 hr flight and a 3.5 hr train journey like we did.

Suprisingly we didn't come across any tourist traps except the private taxis, I guess because there are not a lot of tourists and even those are mostly russian tourists.

# Things we did not expect

Lots of koreans in Almaty. We saw a decent amount of koreans - maybe even upwards of `30%` of people were of korean decent. They are the next generation of `Koryo-saram`.

> Koryo-saram 고려사람 are ethnic Koreans in the post-Soviet states that descend from Koreans who were living in the Russian Far East.

In 1937, the Korean population in the Russian Far East was forced to migrate to Central-Asia. A number of early Koryo-saram were significant Korean independence activists during the Japanese colonial period, such as Hong Beom-do and Chŏng Sang-chin. They have since dispersed throughout the former Soviet Union, with populations in Siberia, Uzbekistan, Ukraine - [read more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koryo-saram)

Roads are slippery, you will fall atleast once in your trip if you come here during the winter.

`Water` - It's a problem. You need to buy drinking water to get by.

I might be generalizing a bit here but we geniunely felt people were reserved, unenthusiatic and a little depressed even. Although every single person helped us. I guess its more of the european culture of `minding your own business`. One incident that comes to mind is when we saw a 6 year old spill his drink in the mall and his mom gazed at him as if she would disown him immediately - which felt like an over-reaction to an outsider like me and the look on the kids face was priceless.

Almost everyone had an `iPhone Pro Max`, financed off-course but at 0% interest split payments for up to 24 months. *Казах без понтов, беспонтовый казах* is a saying which translates to - *Kazakh without bragging, is a bad Kazakh*

Kazakhstan 🇰🇿 has digital payments almost everywhere thanks to [Kaspi](https://kaspi.kz/)

Kazakh songs are amazing! To name a few...
